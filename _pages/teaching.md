## Econometrics 1, University of Copenhagen (Spring 2025)

This is a 2nd year BA Economics course, taught by Mette Ejrnæs. As a teaching assistant, I held weekly exercise classes and corrected assignments for a class of approximately 30 students. The course covers multiple linear regression models, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation, hypothesis testing, and more advanced topics including Instrumental Variables (IV), panel data methods, and time series regression. See [course syllabus](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%C3%98kb08020u) for more details.
