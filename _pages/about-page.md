I am a third year PhD student in Economics at the University of Copenhagen, enrolled in the 3+5 program. My research focuses on the study of public policies and regulation in education markets, with a particular emphasis on school choice, field experiments, and information barriers.

I work closely with collaborators and policy makers to design, evaluate, and implement education policies that aim to expand equitable opportunities for human capital accumulation.
